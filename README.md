### Hello there! I'm Nils

I like coding, a lot. It's like magic, but better. You can reuse it, you can fully automate everything, you can combine all things together! It's crazy!

For some years I developed full stack, some I spend in DevOps. Currently my job is to automate infrastructure and to secure heavily automated infrastructure, before it comes around to bite you. 


I'm interested in compiler and programming language related research. I like talking about tech things at conferences like hannoverJS.
Love to make music, used to be in a band, spend years in an orchestra. Never missing a chance to teach about whatever I can, I'm always the one to learn the most that way.
